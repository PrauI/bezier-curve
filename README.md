# bezier-curve
👨‍💻 I am coding a bezier editor in Javascript with p5js. 

This Project is not ment to become a user friendly application, but is more a kind of a challange for my self. As I am a really uneducated and selftought programmer, I would love to get constructive feedback to improve my code and Project.
